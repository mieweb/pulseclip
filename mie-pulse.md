# The MIE Way of Working

### **A Philosophy of Momentum, Visibility, and Institutional Learning**

## **This Is Not Scrum (and It Is Not Not Scrum)**

Update From: [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YgrZ8xqOyL5fwGafFapuIFtb_D12LEjCjVZpbDlMdiE/edit?tab=t.0) 

At MIE, we borrow ideas from Scrum and Agile — but we are not religious about frameworks.

Scrum is a **tool**, not a belief system.  
Agile is a **mindset**, not a certification.

We care less about whether something follows a textbook definition and more about whether it:

- Produces momentum  
- Makes progress visible  
- Helps people learn from each other  
- Scales human intelligence, not meetings

If you already “know Scrum,” this will feel familiar — and different.  
If you’ve never worked in Agile, this will feel intuitive.

---

## **Our First Principle: Work Should Speak for Itself**

The best indicator of progress is not a report.  
It’s the work itself.

At MIE, we emphasize **showing over telling**:

- A passing test  
- A UI change  
- A query returning the right shape  
- A failing build that explains a risk

If a picture is worth a thousand words, then a short video of real work is worth far more than a spoken update.

This is why we encourage **beats** — small, frictionless captures of work as it happens. Not to document effort, but to **surface reality**.

---

## **Individuals at Their Best, Not Managed at Their Worst**

We do not assume people need to be watched to work well.

We assume:

- People want to do meaningful work  
- People want to improve  
- People do better when they can see progress

Our systems are designed to **amplify good behavior**, not police bad behavior.

When someone captures beats throughout the day:

- They reflect naturally on progress  
- They see momentum (or lack of it)  
- They adjust earlier instead of later

This creates **self-management**, which is the highest form of productivity.

---

## **Meetings Are for Decisions, Not Narration**

In traditional standups, people often narrate what already happened — slowly, inconsistently, and selectively.

At MIE, we separate **information sharing** from **discussion**.

- Information is shared asynchronously and silently  
- Discussion happens only after everyone has context  
- Live time is reserved for:  
  - Blockers  
  - Dependencies  
  - Decisions  
  - Learning

This respects everyone’s time and cognitive energy.

---

## **Communication Is a System, Not a Performance**

We are not optimizing for eloquence.  
We are optimizing for **clarity and continuity**.

Shorts and beats are intentionally:

- Unpolished  
- Unedited  
- Honest

We believe in the [**cult of done**](https://medium.com/@bre/the-cult-of-done-manifesto-724ca1c2ff13):

- Progress over perfection  
- Reality over storytelling  
- Momentum over appearance

This makes communication safer, faster, and more truthful.

---

## **Institutional Learning Is a First-Class Outcome**

Every beat contributes to more than just today’s standup.

Over time, these artifacts:

- Show how problems were actually solved  
- Capture decision paths, not just outcomes  
- Create a living memory of how the organization works

This is how individual effort turns into **institutional knowledge**.

New hires ramp faster.  
Managers see patterns earlier.  
Teams learn from each other without extra meetings.

---

## **Accountability Through Visibility, Not Pressure**

We do not believe accountability comes from fear.

We believe it comes from **shared visibility**.

When work is visible:

- Progress is obvious  
- Stalls are obvious  
- Help can arrive earlier

This makes accountability natural and non-personal.  
The work speaks louder than any status update ever could.

---

## **For Developers**

You are trusted to:

- Capture reality, not justify it  
- Show progress when it happens  
- Surface blockers early

This system is designed to **save you time**, not cost it. If it feels heavy, it’s being used incorrectly.

---

## **For Managers**

Your role is not to extract updates.

Your role is to:

- Observe patterns  
- Remove friction  
- Enable momentum  
- Protect focus

This approach gives you signal without interruption — and context without control.

---

## **In Closing**

MIE’s way of working is built on a simple belief:

When people can see real progress, they naturally move toward better outcomes.

Everything else — Scrum, Agile, tools, rituals — exists only to support that truth.

# MIE Glossary of Terms

### **A Shared Language for Momentum, Visibility, and Learning**

This glossary defines how MIE uses common industry terms — and where we intentionally extend or reinterpret them.

---

## **Short**

**Industry term. Broad. Familiar.**

A *short* is a widely understood concept across the internet:

- Instagram Shorts  
- YouTube Shorts  
- TikTok videos  
- Any brief, consumable video meant to convey information quickly

At MIE, we embrace this familiarity — but we go further.

A short is the *format*.  
A pulse is the *system*.

---

## **Pulse**

**MIE’s canonical unit of work communication.**

At MIE:

- A **pulse is a short**  
- A **short is a pulse**

The terms are interchangeable in everyday language.

However, *pulse* is the preferred term because it conveys intent:

- A pulse reflects **life**  
- A pulse shows **momentum**  
- A pulse communicates **change over time**

A pulse is not just a video — it is a **structured container of meaning**.

---

## **Beat**

**The atomic unit of a pulse.**

A **beat** is a very short capture — typically **15–20 seconds** — that represents something worth knowing.

A beat can be:

- A fact you need to know  
- A screen you need to see  
- A decision that was made  
- A change in state  
- A moment of progress  
- A blocker or risk  
- A teaser for what comes next

Beats are:

- Push-to-talk  
- Unedited  
- Unpolished  
- Captured as work happens

If a short is a sentence,  
a beat is a word.

---

## **Beat Types (Common Patterns)**

Beats can serve different purposes inside a pulse:

### **Lead Beat (The Catch / TL;DR)**

- Placed at the front of a pulse  
- Answers: *“Why should I watch this?”*  
- Shows the outcome first  
  (“Tell me about the baby before the birth.”)

### **Progress Beats**

- Show what changed  
- Show how it changed  
- Show why it changed  
- Often captured naturally throughout the day

### **Evidence Beats**

- Screens  
- Tests  
- Visual proof  
- Demonstrations

### **Teaser Beat**

- Placed at the end of a pulse  
- Sets up tomorrow’s work  
- Signals what’s coming next

---

## **Pulse Structure (Ideal Form)**

An ideal pulse often looks like this:

1. **Lead Beat** – outcome and context  
2. **Progress Beats** – what / why / how  
3. **Teaser Beat** – what’s next

This structure is encouraged but never forced.

---

## **PulseCam**

**The capture tool.**

PulseCam is the camera application designed for:

- Taking many small beats  
- Capturing work as it happens  
- Accumulating progress naturally  
- Assembling beats into a pulse

PulseCam is optimized for:

- Zero friction  
- Push-to-talk capture  
- “Put the phone down and keep working”

---

## **PulseClip**

**The extraction and editing tool.**

PulseClip is used when work already exists in longer form:

- Meetings  
- Screen recordings  
- Long demos  
- Recorded walkthroughs

PulseClip:

- Uses AI to identify meaningful moments  
- Extracts beats from long videos  
- Lets you create pulses by highlighting text  
- Cuts video automatically with the words

Highlight text → the clip comes with it.

PulseClip is how long-form content becomes pulse-ready.

---

## **Hyperlinked Beats**

**Beats as references, not just media.**

A key distinction between a pulse and a generic short:

- Beats inside a pulse are **addressable**  
- Beats can be **linked**  
- Beats can be **reused**

You can:

- Point directly to a specific beat  
- Create a pulse that references a beat from someone else’s pulse  
- Share only the relevant moment, not the entire video

Think of beats like:

- Paragraph anchors in a document  
- Hyperlinks inside an article

This enables **composability** and **institutional memory**.

---

## **TimeHarbor**

**Your personal rhythm and telemetry tool.**

TimeHarbor is an **individual-first application**, not a management surveillance tool.

It provides:

- Time tracking (optional)  
- Passive telemetry via ActivityWatch  
- Gentle reminders to check in  
- A private place to jot notes and compose beats  
- Calendar and activity awareness for passive entries

Key principle:

TimeHarbor belongs to the individual.

The company does not treat it as a monitoring system. It exists to help you establish rhythm, reflection, and continuity.

---

## **ActivityWatch**

**Passive context, not judgment.**

ActivityWatch integrates with TimeHarbor to:

- Detect meetings  
- Observe application usage  
- Help reconstruct a day without manual effort

It is used to:

- Reduce cognitive load  
- Improve recall  
- Enable better summaries

---

## **Jerry**

**Your personal execution agent.**

Jerry is an AI agent whose job is to:

- Help summarize your day  
- Coach you on making better beats  
- Suggest structure and clarity  
- Remind you to capture moments  
- Help you “show the money”

Jerry is:

- Named after *Jerry Maguire*  
- Built on the Ozwell framework  
- Privacy-first by design

Your conversations with Jerry:

- Are private  
- Are not visible to the company  
- Are controlled entirely by you

You decide:

- What becomes a beat  
- What becomes a pulse  
- What gets shared

---

## **Ozwell**

**The privacy foundation.**

Ozwell is the underlying framework that ensures:

- No retained conversations  
- No hidden data reuse  
- Individual ownership of outputs

Ozwell enables:

- Coaching without surveillance  
- Assistance without exposure  
- Trust by default

---

## **Cult of Done**

**A cultural principle.**

At MIE:

- Progress beats perfection  
- Reality beats performance  
- Done beats polished

No editing stage. No retakes. No overthinking.

If it takes more than five minutes to prepare a pulse, it’s being [done wrong](https://medium.com/@bre/the-cult-of-done-manifesto-724ca1c2ff13).

---

## **In Summary**

- **Beats** capture moments  
- **Pulses** tell stories  
- **Shorts** are the format  
- **PulseCam** captures  
- **PulseClip** extracts  
- **TimeHarbor** creates rhythm  
- **Jerry** coaches and summarizes

Together, they form a system where:

Work speaks for itself  
Learning compounds  
And individuals operate at their best
